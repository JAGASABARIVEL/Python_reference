# sanity\_scripts
These scripts take 1 or 2 arguments. The first arg is a labname which boils down to a directory which must exist in the config directory \(a level or 2 up\). The optional 2nd arg is a file containing yaml which overrides the yaml defined by the labname.

These may be run individually or as part of the _sanity_ script in the directory above.
